  "page_2_left_column": "Human Design is a vast and complex system. Nevertheless, the rewards for studying and experienting with Human Design are vast. Some are immediate. Some take years. And some rewards don't look at all like rewards, at first. But we believe that with no small amount of effort, everyone can benefit from Human Design.\n\nThis booklet contains everything you need to know to begin your experiment. Type, Strategy, and Authority are at the heart of Human Design. Type tells us how we are designed to operate in the totality. What is our role for the totality? What purpose do we have, in the big picture? (Profile and Incarnation Cross give us hints in these areas, too.)",
  "page_2_right_column": "Strategy tells us how we are designed to move through the world, and is intimately linked with Type. Finally, Authority tells us what inside ourselves we can really trust. Our whole lives we've been trusting what we're not, and ignoring what we are. Human Design reverses that. For the first time, we are shown who we areâ€”what inside of us we can always trust, always, to make the right decision. We are also shown who we are not, the Not Self Gates and Centers. Human Design teaches us to step into who we truly are, fearlessly, shamelessly, and unabashedly true to ourselves. Come with us on this journey of self discovery unlike any other.",
